# PuffVibe

A small collection of vaporwave / lo‑fi web experiments — hazy visuals, playful UI riffs, and lightweight audio moments built with JavaScript.

## Quick start
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Joykan/puffvibe-master.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a simple static server.
3. Tweak the JS/CSS files to remix the vibe.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or PRs. This repo is meant to be playful — forks and creative experiments are encouraged.
